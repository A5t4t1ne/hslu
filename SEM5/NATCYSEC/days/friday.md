## Cybersecurity

Cyber operations have evolved from early computer security measures to complex strategies involving state actors.


### Historical context

- WW1: British decrypt German communications for mexico
- WW2: US and British decrypt Imperial Japanese Army communications


### Intelligence Disciplines

- HUMINT - Information collected from human sources
- MASINT - Scientific and technical intelligence used to locate
- SIGINT - interception of signals
- IMNT - Representation of objects reproduced electronically
- GEOINT - Imagery and geospatial data produced through an integration of imagery.


### Milestones

- 1990s: Early cyber espionage
- 2000s: Rise of nation-state operations with attacks such as Stuxnet (2010)
- 2010s: Increased sophistication in CI, including APT operations by nation-states
- 2020s: Growing trend of using cyber capabilities for influence operations


### Genesis

- U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) established 2010
- Founding organizations:
    - NSA
    - Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) (civilian and military)
    - Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCC-NW)


### Operations in Government

- Disruptions of Adversarial Activities
- Cyber Espionage
- Information Warfare and influence operations


### Threat Landscape

- Escalation of eCrime: 76%
- Nation-State Activity: Russia, China, North Korea and Iran - most active nation states
- Cloud Vulnerabilities: 75% increase in cloud intrusions
- Social Engineering & Identity Exploits: Phishing and other social engineering techniques remain critical entry points


### Emerging Cybersecurity Threats for 2024
