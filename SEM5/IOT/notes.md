## What is IoT 

- Smart homes
- Transportation - internet-enabled communication
- Retail - Intelligent services
- Industrial - M2M comm
- Smart Energy - Power awareness and saving energy


### Challenges

- Software updates (remote)
- System Management - software vulnerabilities
- Ability to operate on low power 
- Networking - TCP too expensive 

### Requirements 

- Sensing, Computing, Communication 
- Balance of computation & energy efficiency
- Securely collect, store, process data 


### Edge vs Fog Computing 

**Edge:** 

- Compute and storage systems reside at the edge -> close to the devices/sensors 
- Processing data at the edge; no need for cloud processing 
- Goal: Efficiency - Low latency, speed, performance

**Fog:** 

- Defines how edge computing should work 
- Extends computing to the edge of the network 
- Pushes compute out of centralized systems/clouds - better and more scalable performance 
- Goal: Bring cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network
